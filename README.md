# Deathcount

by KADW (KADW#4425)

Rain World 1.9 edition, Version 1.3.1

A small mod for Rain World 1.9 that displays number of deaths on the sleep/death screen and save file select screen.

Available through Steam Workshop/Remix at [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2920640816), so get it from there. Commented source files are in this repo.

If you don't have Rain World through Steam, you can still install this mod by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP. Move Deathcount_final into your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder.

Note: the newest update may also prevent the mod from working at all. It worked when I uploaded it, but the version I download doesn't work for some reason? Not sure why? I will try to fix it later. If Deathcount appears to suddenly have broken, this is why.
