Last updated March 5, 2023: an error that crashed the game with SlugBase enabled should hopefully be fixed.

Note: the newest update may also prevent the mod from working at all. It worked when I uploaded it, but the version I download doesn't work for some reason? Not sure why? I will try to fix it later. If Deathcount appears to suddenly have broken, this is why.
