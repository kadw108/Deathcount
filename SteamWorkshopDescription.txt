Shows each slugcat's number of deaths on the sleep/death screen and save file select screen.

Commented source code, and mod folder for non-Steam players, available at https://github.com/kadw108/deathcount/tree/RW1.9

If you run into errors, you can message KADW#4425 on Discord. Include the consoleLog.txt and possible exceptionLog.txt file in your Rain World folder. Thanks!

Last updated March 5, 2023: an error that crashed the game with SlugBase enabled should hopefully be fixed.
